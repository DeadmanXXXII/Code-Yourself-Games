So today I built my own lab.
Clickjacked by Nethunter. 
Works well and in the third last photo you can see my almost opaque overlay in the hosted files.

To do this lab you have to have nethunter this can be for android or iPhone there are two ways to do this that works.

One: find David Bombal on YouTube the link is in FreeU.txt find his Nethunter installation video and follow the steps.

Two: My way
download and install termux from https://termux.dev/
or 
https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/6726

pkg install wget
wget -U https://findlinkyourself/os-version/install-nethunter-full-termux 
pkg update && upgrade 
./install-nethunter-full-termux
cd downloads
ls -a
kali-arm64
kalifs-arm64-full.tar.xz
kalifs-arm64-full.sha512sum
nh -r
dpkg --configure -a
(this took my phones 4 days Google pixels 3a + 4)
apt update && upgrade -y
(this takes a while)
apt install python3
apt install wget -y

Lab Begins:

If you don't have a code editor use GitHub.dev it comes with vsstudio code in the Web browser editor to alter things. 

firstly make the lab directory
mkdir self_hosting

cd self_hosting

then you need to get these files 
wget -u https://github.dev/DeadmanXXXII/5-day-coding-challenge/blame/main/Day%205%20challenge%203.html -O index.html

ls

cat index.html

then
python3 -m http.server 8000

Into a web browser on your phone. 
Make sure not to close the app just change so it runs in the background and go to URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000/ you should see the page. How to make tea.
Once that's correct hit the command below.

Ctrl C

then

wget -u https://github.dev/DeadmanXXXII/5-day-coding-challenge/blame/main/Day%205%20challenge%203.css -O index.css

python3 -m http.server 8000

go back to your web browser https://0.0.0.0:8000/ it should have changed slightly and is now responding on two of the icons and has orange headers.

Ctrl C again to stop the server again.

Now this time you are copying 

wget -u https://github.dev/DeadmanXXXII/attack/blame/main/clickjackingselfhost.html -O index.html

ensure href=http://0.0.0.0:8000/
or.    src=same as above unless it ends with .img or .jpeg that is the hosted picture which you can change for a malicious one at a later lab.
if not
nano index.html
or
vim index.html
and paste that in above if it has quotes out it in quotes.

python3 --version make sure it says over 3.11.0

python3 -m http.server 8000

Go back to your browser and as you scroll through the page and the click me button should appear.

Lab complete.

If the button hasn't appeared then that attack doesn't work with your particular phone OS only change the GitHub link for other clickjacking attacks running any others especially incorrectly can land you in jail.

Change the attacks as mentioned above they all only need the same alterations they will say WhatsApp or GitHub from bug hunting. They say they have defense what'sapp didn't. 
GitHub owned me though no matter how complicated I built it. 
Some just have an opaque overlay, others have just the word click me with an invisible button, some when you touch text will redirect you to my website or a .json file you can also host.

Happy hacking hackers.

This labelled.mp4 as once I'm home I'll be on my computer and will upload videos if I can figure out how to video upload in the GitHub.dev app just found this today.
