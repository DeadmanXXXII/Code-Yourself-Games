If you run this script on a system where VirtualBox is installed, it will configure and set up a VirtualBox VM named "pokemon" with Ubuntu installed, along with a Ruby on Rails application with intentionally vulnerable configurations. 

Here's how you can proceed:

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `Pokemon_vm.sh`.
2. Replace `/path/to/ubuntu.iso` with the actual path to your Ubuntu ISO file.
3. Make the script executable by running: `chmod +x Pokemon_vm.sh`.
4. Run the script: `./Pokemon_vm.sh`.

The script will then proceed to create and configure the VM. Once the setup is complete, you can launch VirtualBox and start the "pokemon" VM to access the Ubuntu environment with the vulnerable Ruby on Rails application installed.
It's the same for the second one PokemonVM2.sh just a different machine, attacks to use and flag to get.

   - `VM_HDD_SIZE`: Size of the virtual hard disk (in MB).
   - `USER`: Username for the user account to be created inside the VM.
   - `PASSWORD_HASH`: Hashed password for the user account. You can generate it using `echo -n 'your_password' | sha512sum | cut -d' ' -f1` command.
   - `JOKE_FLAG`: A joke flag to be placed on the VM's desktop.

4. **Run the Script**: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script, and execute it using the command:
   ```
   bash script_name.sh
   ```

5. **Follow Instructions**: The script will create and configure the VM, install software, create a vulnerable Ruby on Rails application, and place a joke flag on the desktop.
